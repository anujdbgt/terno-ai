=====
Q: Since the models are caching the database schema in the django, if there are changes in original data source, this will fail?
A: Yes, it will fail. We would display the error in logs and to the users so that the admins can debug it.

Q: If we change the data source, what happens to the config?
A: As of now, we are not providing a way to change the data source. In future, we can provide a way to migrate with minimal edits.
